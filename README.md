## Motivation

Setting up a new developer machine can be an **ad-hoc, manual, and time-consuming** process.  `dev-setup` aims to **simplify** the process with **easy-to-understand instructions** and **dotfiles/scripts** to **automate the setup** of the following:

* **OS X updates and Xcode Command Line Tools**
* **OS X defaults** geared towards developers
* **Developer tools**: Vim, bash, tab completion, curl, git, GNU core utils, Python, Ruby, etc
* **Developer apps**: iTerm2, Sublime Text, Atom, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, Chrome, etc
* **Python data analysis**: IPython Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc
* **Big Data platforms**: Spark (with IPython Notebook integration) and MapReduce
* **Cloud services**: Amazon Web Services (Boto, AWS CLI, S3cmd, etc) and Heroku
* **Common data stores**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch
* **Javascript web development**: Node.js, JSHint, and Less
* **Android development**: Java, Android SDK, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA

### But...I Don't Need All These Tools!

**`dev-setup` is geared to be more of an organized *reference* of various developer tools.**

**You're *not* meant to install everything.**

If you're interested in automation, `dev-setup` provides a customizable [setup script](#single-setup-script).  There's really no one-size-fits-all solution for developers so you're encouraged to make tweaks to suit your needs.

[Credits](#credits): This repo builds on the awesome work from [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) and [Nicolas Hery](https://github.com/nicolashery).

### For Automation, What About Vagrant, Docker, or Boxen?

[Vagrant](#vagrant) and [Docker](#docker) are great tools and are set up by this repo. I've found that Vagrant works well to ensure dev matches up with test and production tiers. I've only started playing around with Docker for side projects and it looks very promising. However, for Mac users, Docker and Vagrant both rely on **virtual machines**, which have their own considerations/pros/cons.

[Boxen](https://boxen.github.com/) is a cool solution, although some might find it better geared towards "more mature companies or devops teams". I've seen some discussions of [difficulties as it is using Puppet under the hood](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/issues/742).

This repo takes a more **light-weight** approach to automation using a combination of **Homebrew, Homebrew Cask, and shell scripts** to do basic system setup.  It also provides **easy-to understand instructions** for installation, configuration, and usage for each developer app or tool.

## Section 1: Installation

### Single Setup Script

#### Running with Git

##### Clone the Repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup.git && cd dev-setup

##### Run the .dots Script with Command Line Arguments

**Since you probably don't want to install every section**, the `.dots` script supports command line arguments to run only specified sections.  Simply pass in the [scripts](#scripts) that you want to install.  Below are some examples.

**For more customization, you can [clone](#clone-the-repo) or [fork](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/fork) the repo and tweak the `.dots` script and its associated components to suit your needs.**

Run all:

    $ ./.dots all

Run `bootstrap.sh`, `osxprep.sh`, `brew.sh`, and `osx.sh`:

    $ ./.dots bootstrap osxprep brew osx

Run `bootstrap.sh`, `osxprep.sh`, `brew.sh`, and `osx.sh`, `pydata.sh`, `aws.sh`, and `datastores.sh`:

    $ ./.dots bootstrap osxprep brew osx pydata aws datastores

#### Running without Git

    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/master/.dots && ./.dots [Add ARGS Here]

#### Scripts

* [.dots](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/.dots)
    * Runs specified scripts
* [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/bootstrap.sh)
    * Syncs dev-setup to your local home directory `~`
* [osxprep.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/osxprep.sh)
    * Updates OS X and installs Xcode command line tools
* [brew.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/brew.sh)
    * Installs common Homebrew formulae and apps
* [osx.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/osx.sh)
    * Sets up OS X defaults geared towards developers

    * Sets up JavaScript web development
* [android.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/android.sh)
    * Sets up Android development

**Notes:**

* `.dots` will initially prompt you to enter your password.
* `.dots` might ask you to re-enter your password at certain stages of the installation.
* If OS X updates require a restart, simply run `.dots` again to resume where you left off.
* When installing the Xcode command line tools, a dialog box will confirm installation.
    * Once Xcode is installed, follow the instructions on the terminal to continue.
* `.dots` runs `brew.sh`, which takes awhile to complete as some formulae need to be installed from source.
* **When `.dots` completes, be sure to restart your computer for all updates to take effect.**

I encourage you to read through Section 1 so you have a better idea of what each installation script does.  The following discussions describe in greater detail what is executed when running the [.dots](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/.dots) script.

### bootstrap.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/commands.png">
  <br/>
</p>

The `bootstrap.sh` script will sync the dev-setup repo to your local home directory.  This will include customizations for Vim, bash, curl, git, tab completion, aliases, a number of utility functions, etc.  Section 2 of this repo describes some of the customizations.

#### Running with Git

First, fork or [clone the repo](#clone-the-repo).  The `bootstrap.sh` script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder `~`:

    $ source bootstrap.sh

To update later on, just run that command again.

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

    $ set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh

#### Running without Git

To sync dev-setup to your local home directory without Git, run the following:

    $ cd ~; curl -#L https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh,LICENSE}

To update later on, just run that command again.

#### Optional: Specify PATH

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files before any feature testing (such as detecting which version of `ls` is being used takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Optional: Add Custom Commands

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Donne Martin"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="donne.martin@gmail.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"

# Pip should only run if there is a virtualenv currently activated
export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true

# Install or upgrade a global package
# Usage: gpip install –upgrade pip setuptools virtualenv
gpip(){
   PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV="" pip "$@"
}
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions, and aliases from the dev-setup repository, although it’s probably better to [fork the dev-setup repository](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/fork).

### osxprep.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/xcode.jpg">
  <br/>
</p>

Run the `osxprep.sh` script:

    $ ./osxprep.sh

`osxprep.sh` will first install all updates.  If a restart is required, simply run the script again.  Once all updates are installed, `osxprep.sh` will then [Install Xcode Command Line Tools](#install-xcode-command-line-tools).

If you want to go the manual route, you can also install all updates by running "App Store", selecting the "Updates" icon, then updating both the OS and installed apps.

#### Install Xcode Command Line Tools

An important dependency before many tools such as Homebrew can work is the **Command Line Tools for Xcode**. These include compilers like gcc that will allow you to build from source.

If you are running **OS X 10.9 Mavericks or later**, then you can install the Xcode Command Line Tools directly from the command line with:

    $ xcode-select --install

**Note**: the `osxprep.sh` script executes this command.

Running the command above will display a dialog where you can either:
* Install Xcode and the command line tools
* Install the command line tools only
* Cancel the install

##### OS X 10.8 and Older

If you're running 10.8 or older, you'll need to go to [http://developer.apple.com/downloads](http://developer.apple.com/downloads), and sign in with your Apple ID (the same one you use for iTunes and app purchases). Unfortunately, you're greeted by a rather annoying questionnaire. All questions are required, so feel free to answer at random.

Once you reach the downloads page, search for "command line tools", and download the latest **Command Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for Xcode**. Open the **.dmg** file once it's done downloading, and double-click on the **.mpkg** installer to launch the installation. When it's done, you can unmount the disk in Finder.

### brew.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/homebrew2.png">
  <br/>
</p>

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), a package manager that simplifies installing and updating applications or libraries.

Some of the apps installed by the `brew.sh` script include: Chrome, Firefox, Sublime Text, Atom, Dropbox, Evernote, Skype, Slack, Alfred, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, etc.  **For a full listing of installed formulae and apps, refer to the commented [brew.sh source file](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/brew.sh) directly and tweak it to suit your needs.**

Run the `brew.sh` script:

    $ ./brew.sh

The `brew.sh` script takes awhile to complete, as some formulae need to be installed from source.

**For your terminal customization to take full effect, quit and re-start the terminal**

### osx.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/osx.png">
  <br/>
</p>

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set OS X defaults geared towards developers.  The `osx.sh` script also configures common third-party apps such Sublime Text and Chrome.

**Note**: **I strongly encourage you read through the commented [osx.sh source file](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/osx.sh) and tweak any settings based on your personal preferences.  The script defaults are intended for you to customize.**  For example, if you are not running an SSD you might want to change some of the settings listed in the SSD section.

Run the `osx.sh` script:

    $ ./osx.sh

**For your terminal customization to take full effect, quit and re-start the terminal.**

### pydata.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/pydata.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up a development environment to work with Python and data analysis without relying on the more heavyweight [Anaconda](#anaconda) distribution, run the `pydata.sh` script:

    $ ./pydata.sh

This will install [Virtualenv](#virtualenv) and [Virtualenvwrapper](#virtualenvwrapper).  It will then set up two virtual environments loaded with the packages you will need to work with data in Python 2 and Python 3.

To switch to the Python 2 virtual environment, run the following Virtualenvwrapper command:

    $ workon py2-data

To switch to the Python 3 virtual environment, run the following Virtualenvwrapper command:

    $ workon py3-data

Then start working with the installed packages, for example:

    $ ipython notebook

[Section 3: Python Data Analysis](#section-3-python-data-analysis) describes the installed packages and usage.

### aws.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/aws.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up a development environment to work with Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, and Amazon Web Services, run the `aws.sh` script:

    $ ./aws.sh

[Section 4: Big Data, AWS, and Heroku](#section-4-big-data-aws-and-heroku) describes the installed packages and usage.

### datastores.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/datastores.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up common data stores, run the `datastores.sh` script:

    $ ./datastores.sh

[Section 5: Data Stores](#section-5-data-stores) describes the installed packages and usage.

### web.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/webdev.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up a JavaScript web development environment, Run the `web.sh` script:

    $ ./web.sh

[Section 6: Web Development](#section-6-web-development) describes the installed packages and usage.

### android.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/android.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up an Android development environment, run the `android.sh` script:

    $ ./android.sh

[Section 7: Android Development](#section-7-android-development) describes the installed packages and usage.

## Section 2: General Apps and Tools

### Sublime Text

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/sublime.png">
  <br/>
</p>

With the terminal, the text editor is a developer's most important tool. Everyone has their preferences, but unless you're a hardcore [Vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) user, a lot of people are going to tell you that [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is currently the best one out there.

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Sublime Text.

If you prefer to install it separately, go ahead and [download](http://www.sublimetext.com/) it. Open the **.dmg** file, drag-and-drop in the **Applications** folder.

**Note**: At this point I'm going to create a shortcut on the OS X Dock for both for Sublime Text. To do so, right-click on the running application and select **Options > Keep in Dock**.

Sublime Text is not free, but I think it has an unlimited "evaluation period". Anyhow, we're going to be using it so much that even the seemingly expensive $70 price tag is worth every penny. If you can afford it, I suggest you [support](http://www.sublimetext.com/buy) this awesome tool.

#### Configuration

The [osx.sh script](#osxsh-script) contains Sublime Text configurations.

#### Soda Theme

The [Soda Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) is a great UI theme for Sublime Text, especially if you use a dark theme and think the side bar sticks out like a sore thumb.

##### Installation with Sublime Package Control

If you are using Will Bond's excellent [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can easily install Soda Theme via the `Package Control: Install Package` menu item. The Soda Theme package is listed as `Theme - Soda` in the packages list.

##### Installation with Git

Alternatively, if you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text application settings area.

You can locate your Sublime Text `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:

    $ git clone https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/ "Theme - Soda"

##### Activating the Theme on Sublime Text 2

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme"` or `"theme": "Soda Dark.sublime-theme"`

**Example Sublime Text 2 User Settings**

    {
        "theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme"
    }

##### Activating the Theme on Sublime Text 3

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
